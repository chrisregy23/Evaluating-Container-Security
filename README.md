# SoK: Evaluating Container Security

This project provides a comprehensive evaluation of container security, focusing on the risks, vulnerabilities, and exploits associated with container technologies. It explores the mechanisms that enable container isolation, such as cgroups, namespaces, Seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux, and analyzes real-world vulnerabilities like kernel exploits and container escape techniques. By developing an attack tree and categorizing threats using NIST guidelines, this project aims to identify key security challenges and propose mitigation strategies to enhance the security of containerized environments.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Security Analysis**: Explores the major risks, vulnerabilities, and exploits in container technologies, focusing on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack Tree Development**: Develops an attack tree based on identified threats to container security, providing a structured view of potential attack vectors.
- **Focus on Container Isolation**: Examines the security mechanisms that enable container isolation, including cgroups, namespaces, Seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux.
- **Real-World Vulnerabilities**: Analyzes real-world vulnerabilities such as kernel exploits (e.g., CVE-2022-0492, Dirty Pipe) and container escape techniques.
- **Threat Categorization**: Uses NIST’s Application Container Security Guide to categorize threats into vulnerabilities in images, registries, orchestrators, containers, and operating systems.

## Deliverables
- **Security Evaluation Report**: Detailed documentation of container security threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors.
- **Attack Tree**: A visual representation of potential attacks on containerized applications, including threats to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Recommendations for mitigating container security risks, such as least privilege policies, secure image management, and network security measures.
- **Case Studies**: Analysis of real-world vulnerabilities and exploits, including kernel exploits and container escape techniques.
- **References**: A comprehensive list of references, including NIST guidelines, Docker documentation, and academic papers on container security.

## Learning Objectives
- **Understand Container Security Mechanisms**: Learn how cgroups, namespaces, Seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux contribute to container isolation and security.
- **Identify Container Vulnerabilities**: Explore common vulnerabilities in container images, registries, orchestrators, and operating systems.
- **Develop Attack Trees**: Gain hands-on experience in creating attack trees to model potential threats to containerized applications.
- **Analyze Real-World Exploits**: Study real-world exploits such as kernel vulnerabilities (e.g., Dirty Pipe) and container escape techniques.
- **Implement Mitigation Strategies**: Learn how to apply best practices for securing containerized environments, including least privilege policies, secure image management, and network security.
- **Evaluate Container-Specific OS Security**: Understand the security implications of container-specific operating systems and their limitations.
- **Apply NIST Guidelines**: Use NIST’s Application Container Security Guide to categorize and evaluate container security threats.
- **Enhance Security Awareness**: Develop a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between container performance and security, and how to balance them effectively.
