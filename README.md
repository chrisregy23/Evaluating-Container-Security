# SoK: Evaluating Container Security

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Security Analysis**: Explores the major risks, vulnerabilities, and exploits in container technologies, focusing on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack Tree Development**: Develops an attack tree based on identified threats to container security, providing a structured view of potential attack vectors.
- **Focus on Container Isolation**: Examines the security mechanisms that enable container isolation, including cgroups, namespaces, Seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux.
- **Real-World Vulnerabilities**: Analyzes real-world vulnerabilities such as kernel exploits (e.g., CVE-2022-0492, Dirty Pipe) and container escape techniques.
- **Threat Categorization**: Uses NIST’s Application Container Security Guide to categorize threats into vulnerabilities in images, registries, orchestrators, containers, and operating systems.

## Deliverables
- **Security Evaluation Report**: Detailed documentation of container security threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors.
- **Attack Tree**: A visual representation of potential attacks on containerized applications, including threats to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Recommendations for mitigating container security risks, such as least privilege policies, secure image management, and network security measures.
- **Case Studies**: Analysis of real-world vulnerabilities and exploits, including kernel exploits and container escape techniques.
- **References**: A comprehensive list of references, including NIST guidelines, Docker documentation, and academic papers on container security.

## Learning Objectives
1. **Understand Container Security Mechanisms**: Learn how cgroups, namespaces, Seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux contribute to container isolation and security.
2. **Identify Container Vulnerabilities**: Explore common vulnerabilities in container images, registries, orchestrators, and operating systems.
3. **Develop Attack Trees**: Gain hands-on experience in creating attack trees to model potential threats to containerized applications.
4. **Analyze Real-World Exploits**: Study real-world exploits such as kernel vulnerabilities (e.g., Dirty Pipe) and container escape techniques.
5. **Implement Mitigation Strategies**: Learn how to apply best practices for securing containerized environments, including least privilege policies, secure image management, and network security.
6. **Evaluate Container-Specific OS Security**: Understand the security implications of container-specific operating systems and their limitations.
7. **Apply NIST Guidelines**: Use NIST’s Application Container Security Guide to categorize and evaluate container security threats.
8. **Enhance Security Awareness**: Develop a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between container performance and security, and how to balance them effectively.
